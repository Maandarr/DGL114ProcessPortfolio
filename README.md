### Week 1

**ACTIVITY 0101**:

**The 'Good'**:

An app whose interface that I consider 'good' is Spotify. I've been using the service for years and it's always been easy to navigate. The interface is well laid out on every page. On the main pages, they include large navigation buttons on the bottom for home, search, and your library and a settings toggle in the top right corner. It has good contrast with the text and background so everything is very readable. All of the pages establish a well laid out hierarchy by catching your eye either at the top left with a large heading or in the center with an album cover. Your eyes naturally follow the page down to the rest of the information. The app primarily has a single column layout unless the page is filled with large buttons or albums, in which case, it will have a two column layout.

A negative I could write about Spotify is that it can be hard for a user to find the song queue. In my experience, when a Spotify account is used and shared at work, employees will add songs, playlists, or albums to the queue. It's not outright apparent that an album or playlist was added to a queue from another employees perspective so if they want to play something else, the playlist jumps back to the queue right after the different song was played. This is when you realize the issue and have a hard time finding the queue to remove the other songs. It's only in the currently playing page at the bottom right below the stop/skip/play bar. It's not apparent what the icon is either; three parallel lines with a tiny play symbol on the top line.

<br/>
<br/>

**The 'Poor'**:

The app I've chosen to write about for the 'poor' interface is Daily Mail Online. The general interface of the app is tightly packed together with a lot of ads but there are display settings that allow you to change the colour theme, line spacing, and article text size to adjust to optimize readability. Dark mode has off-white text that's easy on the eyes and makes the tightly packed layout not so harsh to look at while reading the articles.

There are a lot of ads in this app. There's ads in the headers, article lists, articles, and full page ads while scrolling through the article images. There's image ads and loudly coloured, animated ads, and full page ads in the middle of the articles with a whole ton of sponsored ads at the end of the article.

The navigation bar scrolls revealing many (22!) options for different categories of news to view.

**ACTIVITY 0102**:

Some of the things that I find 'usable' and intuitive in an app are:

- Simplicity
- Efficiency
- Long pressing a button brings up options or enabling multiple items to be chosen
- Swiping left or right in email inbox to delete or archive email
- The FAB for creating an email, post, playlist, etc.
- Options to add gifs, images, location, etc to social media posts or messages.
- Live word count if a post has a maximum character limit.
- Being able to view post activity like how many people have seen it, total engagements, etc.
- The keyboard popping up when you click on a text box.
- Being able to reply to someone and have it automatically tag a user.
- Editing your posts and comments
- Offering to translate comments and posts into your default language
- When on an instagram profile or in the search page, it allows you to press and hold an image and it will enlarge the image to view it better
- Double tap to like images or comments
- On buy and sell or marketplace posts, having the message button visible on the post to contact the seller with one tap
- The coveted dark mode.
- Allowing users to search near their location

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>


### Week 8

**Activity 0801**:

The app that I'm going to examine to characterize the app's data storage is Instagram.

* Shared preferences
    * Notification settings
* App-specific files
    * APK, app cache files
* Shared storage
    * Posting news feed posts to other accounts
* Database
    * Account details, log-in info, post data, comments, etc.
* Cloud
    * Private, public, business profiles


<br/>
<br/>

***

<br/>
<br/>

**Activity 0803**:

I don't believe that ToDoList meets the expectations of Material.io.

* The text input doesn't have a sufficient margin spacing on top of the list text. 
* The list items don't have enough spacing to differentiate one item from another despite being numbered. 
* The numbers don't create a visual hierarchy. They should at least be boldened. 
* The text input and add button could just be a FAB instead to allow the list to have more room to be read on the page. 
* You should be able to clear one item at a time instead of the whole list at once. What good is a list if you can't check things off? Each list item could have a check button on the right to choose which to clear.
* If we're adding check buttons for list clearing, then we'll probably want to add dividers between the items to create separation.

<br/>
<br/>

***

<br/>
<br/>

### Week 9

**Activity 0902**:

A Fragment represents a reusable portion of an app's UI, manages its own layout, handles its own input events, and has its own lifecycle. Fragments must be hosted by an activity or another Fragment and cannot be implemented by themselves. 

Fragments allow for modularity and reusability by dividing your UI into discrete chunks. This makes it easier to modify the activity's appearance at runtime. 

Creating a Fragment takes some modifications to the build gradle. You then create a class and extend the AndroidX Fragment class, override its methods and insert your app's logic. You then need to host the fragment to the Activity you want your fragment to be implemented on.

<br/>
<br/>

***

<br/>
<br/>

**Activity 0903**:

The cards in the StudyHelper app could be improved in multiple ways.
 * There could be larger and consistent margins around the cards to create separation.
 * The font sizing can be larger to suit the size of the cards and adjust accordingly to account for title length.
 * When you click on a card, the card could expand overtop of the other cards to reveal the questions/answers. Perhaps all of the questions could be on the same card and you could scroll down to see them all.
 * Perhaps a complementary or analagous colour scheme with the card backgrounds with less saturation. 
 * Dividers between the questions/answers to make separation clear.
 * Could add a nice 1px drop shadow to the cards to create depth.
 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

### Week 10

**Activity 1002**:

Some concerns to consider when implementing notifications an an app are:
* Too many notifications during the day, like reminders, or unecessary notifications, or when an app like facebook decides you need to know when a friend makes a post.
* Make sure not to put personal information in the notification.
* Make sure that when tapping on the notification it takes you to the appropriate activity inside your app.
* Enabling a larger text area so you can view the content of a message or email when tapping on the notification. Super great if you don't want to leave messages left on read.
* Make sure to update an existing notification instead of issuing new ones.
* Consider multiple channels for notifications if appropriate.

<br/>
<br/>

***

<br/>
<br/>

**Activity 1003**:

Some important practices and considerations about notifications are:

* Not using notifications as a primary communication channel.
* Making sure to provide an action to stop a service if they don't want it running. 
* Making sure not to display more than three actions in the expanded notification.
* Making sure to include the app icon and the app name. Headers and timestamps are optional.
* Make sure to always include a content title and supporting information in the content area. A large icon containing an avatar is optional.
* When a user taps in a notification, it should take the user directly to that activity.
* Make sure to summarize and group multiple notifications.
* Do not display redundant actions like 'view comment' when tapping on the notification takes you to that activity anyway.
* Enable typing into notifications to reply to messages or texts.

<br/>
<br/>

***

<br/>
<br/>

### Week 11

**Activity 1101**:

Types of Animations | Description

ValueAnimator | A class that creates a property animation by calculating values from a starting value to an ending value over a specified duration
ObjectAnimator | A subclass of ValueAnimator that allows object properties to be animated without an AnimatorUpdateListener. Can animate a View
AnimatorSet | Plays multiple animations simultaneously, sequentially, or after a delay

**Activity 1103**:

I've learned that motion should be kept informative, focused, and expressive. It is used to form relationships between elements, focuses attention on what is important, and adds character and expressions where words would clutter in their place. 

Motion communicates to the user what can be done in an app, the next steps you should take, emphasizes the important bits, provides feedback, educates the user on how to perform actions. It can add enjoyment while using the app, expresses what the brand is about, reinforces the brand's style, and overall just add to a smooth experience.
